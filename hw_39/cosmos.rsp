Response to
Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"
@-------------------------------------------------
I thought this was pretty interesting, despite the fact that I usually wouldn't watch something
like this on my own. What I thought was kind of interesting was the golden record thing, because I can't imagine
an extraterretrial being knowing what a phonograph is (I don't even think many of us new generation know how 
to use it either), so the phonogrpah thing is not very helpful. What might be more helpful instead may be to 
also send a phonograph there as well, so the extratterretrial beings can have the playback tool as well since they 
probably don't have one themselves. Also, having the voyager just go of towards nowhere doesn't really help at all,
and I think instead what they could have done is aimed at a distant start or something that they would expect to 
have potential forms of extraterretrial life.

Episode 3 - "When Knowledge Conquered Fear"

I thought tyson's reasoning was pretty valid int he beginning, but theres one thing that I'm sitll kind of
confused about which is the Ort clouds, because we aren't able to see it and we don't have any photos of it,
so I'm not too sure why people just decided to take the scientist's theory for fact because there doesn't
seem to be any tangible physical evidence for it.
