/*
Essentailly, what I did was I created a 2d array, wrote a method to populate it,
wrote a method that printed out the elements in a concise way, and also wrote
a method that allows the user to give an input on which two elements to swap.
I made this perpetuate to infinity so the user can keep on swapping, but they
can easily exit using the keyboard shortcut C-c
*/
/*
for version 2, I made horizontal vs vertical changes more understandble to the user.
I did this by previding clear explanations on exactly what to do.
I tried using the color thing someone posted on the quaf but the colors wouldn't render
in the command line thing so I left it out.
